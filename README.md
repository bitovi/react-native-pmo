## React Native vs Expo

Expo is a framework on top on React Native. Expo adds additional features to make development easier and is the recommended approach by the React Native docs. You will need the docs from both projects to work on this repo.

[Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/)

## Setup

Prerequisites: Node >20, NPM

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Install Expo Go

Install Expo Go on your mobile device from the appropriate app store. This will allow you to quickly run demos of this app and others on your mobile device.

### Run

```
npm run start
```

The build will start and display a QR code in your terminal. Android users can scan the code from the Expo Go app. iOS users should use the camera app to scan the code, which will then open in Expo Go.
